# Boston City Employee Payroll list 

This project is to generate three payroll lists for Boston City Employees using JASON and the Document Object Model(DOM).
Three payroll lists were to configure Boston Employee's Top Five Payroll list, Above $100,000 Payroll list, and Boston Employees Payroll list.

In this project, I made a project that JASON data and how I sorted for array data in the Boston City detail list. 
DOM is also a strong display method on the HTML screen because it could give rapid results for the end user's requirements.
