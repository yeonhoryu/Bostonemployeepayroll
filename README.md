Boston City Employee Payroll List

This project aims to generate three payroll lists for Boston City Employees utilizing JSON and the Document Object Model (DOM). 
The three payroll lists include Boston Employee's Top Five Payroll list, Above $100,000 Payroll list, and Boston Employees Payroll list.
In this project, I processed JSON data and implemented sorting for array data in the Boston City employee detail list. 
The DOM proves to be a robust display method on the HTML screen, providing rapid results to meet end-user requirements.
